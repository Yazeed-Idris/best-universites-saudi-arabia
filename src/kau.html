        <h1>About King Abdulaziz University</h1>
        <h3>
            King Abdulaziz University, founded in 1387H/1967G, is named after the founder and first King of modern-day
            Saudi
            Arabia, King Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman al Saud. The University came into existence with the aim of
            promoting
            and providing higher education to the western region of Saudi Arabia. With the support of King Faisal bin
            Abdulaziz and Sheikh Hasan bin Abdullah al A-Sheikh, Minister of Education who chaired the committee for
            establishing the University, the University opened its doors for classes in 1968.

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h3>
            Scientific progress for any nation is measured by its ability to keep up with scientific development about
            the human, the universe and the life. In addition to conducting the necessary research to guarantee its
            continuity and progress. The scientific level of any nation is exemplified by its reservoir of scientific
            research for that community in a certain time, and the ability of that nation to use that reservoir in
            comprehensive development processes that is reflected on life. In other words, there is no progress without
            scientific research. The success of developed nations refers to the fact that scientific research for them
            is the core of any progress. While talking about scientific research, we don't mean natural sciences only.
            But social sciences are also crucial demands to construct any community. The interaction between natural
            scientists and their social and human counterparts is a necessity for the healthy structure of a nation.
            Furthermore, experienced scientists should stand side by side with planners, economists and technicians with
            free access to scientific community. For this reason scientific research is no longer the responsibility of
            scientists only, but it is also a fatal concern for politicians and public interest as well. This is
            attributed to its effect on the community and enabling it to face the new challenges and to cope with the
            current scientific attitudes towards technology.
