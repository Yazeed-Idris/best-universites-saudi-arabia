        <h3>Research Institute</h3>
        <p>We have completely overhauled our research programs! Our new research activities are designed to amplify
            the impact on society, solve challenging problems, and enrich knowledge for all humanity.</p>
        <p>The Research Institute (RI) is the cornerstone of applied research activities at KFUPM. It has created a
            strong research base and is recognized for solving critical scientific and technical problems, as well
            as working on converting knowledge into practice. Working in collaboration with the faculty from
            academic departments and researchers from other research entities, its full-time researchers annually
            produce hundreds of research reports for industrial and government sponsors.</p>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of our research is that it is truly interdisciplinary. We believe that
            it takes the combined knowledge of multiple disciplines to make a truly impactful research. Our new
            research centers are composed of multiple disciplines, and of researchers from multiple departments.</p>
        <p>The Research Institute itself has numerous research centers, spanning engineering research, environment
            and water, refining and petrochemicals, communications and IT, and economics and management systems.</p>
